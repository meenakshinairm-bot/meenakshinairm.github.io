- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- R (tidyverse, ggplot2, Shiny, sf)
- SQL
- Git & GitHub

**Data Analysis**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Statistical Modeling (Linear & Logistic Regression)
- Time-Series Analysis
- Geographic & Spatial Analysis
