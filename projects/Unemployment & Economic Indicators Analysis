# Unemployment & Economic Indicators Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes unemployment trends and their relationship with economic indicators using multiple international and regional datasets.  

The objective was to investigate how GDP relates to unemployment patterns and to identify structural differences across age groups and time periods.

---

## Problem Statement
Unemployment is a critical macroeconomic indicator that reflects economic stability and labor market health.  

This project aims to:

- Examine global and regional unemployment trends  
- Analyze the relationship between GDP and unemployment  
- Compare youth and adult unemployment patterns  
- Apply statistical modeling to quantify economic relationships  

---

## Data Sources

The analysis integrates multiple datasets:

- International unemployment data from the International Labour Organization (ILOSTAT)  
- Regional labor statistics datasets  
- Global GDP indicators  

These datasets were cleaned, merged, and transformed for consistent analysis.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed missing and inconsistent records  
- Standardized country and year formats  
- Aggregated unemployment values where necessary  
- Converted economic indicators to numeric format  
- Applied log transformation to GDP for modeling  

---

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized unemployment trends across years  
- Compared youth (15–24) and adult unemployment patterns  
- Examined distribution of unemployment levels  
- Identified structural differences across age groups  

---

### 3. Statistical Analysis

#### Correlation Analysis
- Measured correlation between GDP and unemployment  
- Identified weak but statistically measurable relationship  

#### Log Transformation
- Applied log transformation to GDP to reduce skewness  
- Improved interpretability of regression model  

#### Linear Regression
- Modeled unemployment as a function of log(GDP)  
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - R-squared  
  - Coefficient significance  
  - Residual diagnostics

## Key Findings

- Youth unemployment is consistently higher than adult unemployment  
- Higher GDP levels are associated with lower unemployment rates  
- The GDP–unemployment relationship is statistically significant but explains only a small portion of variance  
- Structural labor market factors likely play a larger role than GDP alone

## Tools & Technologies

- R  
- tidyverse  
- ggplot2  
- dplyr  
- Linear regression modeling  
- R Markdown (HTML output)

## Technical Highlights

- Multi-dataset integration  
- Data transformation and feature engineering  
- Log transformation of economic indicators  
- Correlation analysis  
- Linear regression modeling  
- Age-group segmentation analysis

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates an end-to-end analytical workflow — from data cleaning and transformation to statistical modeling and interpretation.  

The findings highlight the complexity of labor market dynamics and show that macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, while relevant, do not fully explain unemployment behavior.
